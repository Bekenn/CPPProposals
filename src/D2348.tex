\section{Revisions}

\subsection*{Revision 3}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fix an example which was accidentally normative
    \item remplace "non-whitespace character" by non-whitespace
    \item typos
    \item "Whitespace characters can appear within a preprocessing token only as part of a header name..." is now a note
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Revision 2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wording fixes
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Revision 1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The previous revisions classified Vertical Tab and Form Feed as vertical spaces. This was consistent with Unicode, but not with the current wording, nor with any of the existing implementations. As this paper is trying not to modify the status quo, and because the author cannot find a reason to challenge the status quo, this version treats these codepoints as horizontal whitespaces.
    \item Add a note about \tcode{\textbackslash n\textbackslash r} and other not spelled-out sequences.
    \item Align the grammar in [lex.whitespaces] with terminology used in \paper{P2314R2} and rebase the rest of the wording on top of  \paper{P2314R2}. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Design}

This paper aims to clarify what constitutes a new-line and a whitespace, using Unicode terminology (which is consistent with \paper{P2314R1}).
No breaking behavior change is intended.

\textbf{This paper resolves \paper{CWG2002} and  \paper{CWG1655}}.

\subsection{Make whitespace grammar elements}

For clarity, this paper introduces a grammar for whitespaces, including comments, and then refers to whitespace as grammar terms.
This also makes it easier to extend the list of whitespaces later.
However, the question of extending the list of Unicode characters
treated as whitespace is not explored in this paper.
Non-Unicode source encoding would continue to map their set of whitespaces and new-line to what is currently designated in the standard: CR, FF, LF, VT, SPACE, TAB.

\subsection{Comments}

The proposed wording change makes vertical tabs and form-feed allowed in // comments, rather than make them ill-formed no diagnostic required.

\subsection{VT and FF are treated as horizontal whitespaces}

In R0, \tcode{VT} \tcode{FF} were treated as vertical, line-breaking whitespaces. This was consistent with Unicode.
However, I failed to realize that all implementations treat them as non-breaking whitespaces.
As this paper is not trying to challenge the status quo, which frankly would have little value, it classifies \tcode{VT} and \tcode{FF}
as horizontal whitespaces. As such, an implementation must support them in comments and string/character literals, which is consistent with implementations.

\href{https://compiler-explorer.com/z/9ahz7W7xc}{Compiler explorer}.

Despite the contradition with Unicode, further research showed that treating vertical space and form feed is standard practice in many languages
including C\#, Rust, Java, JavaScript and others.


\subsection{\textbackslash n\textbackslash r}

On BBC Micro and other Acorn systems, \tcode{\textbackslash n\textbackslash r} was used to delimited new lines.
Similarly, some systems may not use any of the sequences for new lines outlined in this paper.
This is consistent with both the status quo and Unicode.
Assuming once could run a modern compiler on a BBC micro (note that this proposal only affects translation, not execution),
the implementation-defined mapping provision allows an implementation to map platform/encoding specific line breaks to \textbackslash n in phase 1
of translation.

Similarly, while this paper tries to preserve sequences of line breaks through phases 1-6 of translation, it is not observable
whether a sequence of line breaks is treated as one or several line-breaks except in the value of \tcode{__LINE__} and \tcode{source_location} whose values are implementation-defined

\subsection{Replace the term \grammarterm{new-line} by \grammarterm{line-break}}

\tcode{new-line} in the wording refers to both an unspecified character to which all source line terminator map to and
a specific, implementation-defined character in the literal character set.
Using different terminology makes it clearer which is which.

\subsection{Do not perform whitespace replacement}

All whitespaces (including comments) are conserved by the proposed wording through phases 1-7.
In practice, this is not observable (and we may want a note stating that somewhere).

Note that some compilers (namely GCC) will emit a diagnostic for the presence of vertical tabs
in preprocessing directives.
With this, such diagnostic in pedantic mode is not necessary for corformance, but might still
be useful [\href{https://godbolt.org/z/r8hdzM6Gx}{Compiler Explorer}].


This fixes \paper{CWG2002}.

\begin{quoteblock}
According to Clause 15 [cpp] paragraphg 4,

\begin{quoteblock}
The only whitespace characters that shall appear between preprocessing tokens within a preprocessing directive (from just after the introducing \# preprocessing token through just before the terminating new-line character) are space and horizontal-tab (including spaces that have replaced comments or possibly other whitespace characters in translation phase 3).
\end{quoteblock}
The effect of this restriction is unclear, however, since translation phase 3 is permitted to transform all white space characters and comments into spaces. The relationship between these two rules should be clarified.
\end{quoteblock}

The list of whitespaces is sufficient to address the needs of
codepoints conservations through phases 1-6 of \paper{P2295R2}.
The clause mentioned in CWG2002 is deleted.

\subsection{The set of character is not expanded}

We do not propose new characters as whitespaces.
However, following Unicode guidelines, we clarify that CRLF is to be considered a single line break.

\subsection{Raw-string literals}

For clarity, that line-breaks are mapped to a new-line in raw-string-literal is made normative.
We intend that this paper addresses \paper{CWG1655}: by using different terms for \grammarterm{line-break} and \grammarterm{new-line}, we make clear that these things are not related.

\section{Wording}
\rSec1[lex.phases]{Phases of translation}%

\ednote{The wording is based on \paper{P2314R2}}

\pnum
\indextext{translation!phases|(}%
The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the
following phases.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    \indextext{character set!basic source}%
    \changed{Physical source file characters are mapped, in an
    \impldef{mapping physical source file characters to basic source character set} manner,
    to the translation character set (introducing new-line characters for end-of-line
    indicators)}{The physical source file is mapped, in an implementation-defined manner, to a sequence of translation character set elements}.

    \ednote{The intent of this reformulation is to get rid of the term "end-of-line-indicator" which is not defined,
    while supporting source files stored as records.}

    The set of physical source file characters accepted is \impldef{physical source file
        characters}.

    \item
    \indextext{line splicing}%
    Each instance of a backslash character (\textbackslash)
    immediately followed by a \clb{new-line character} is deleted, splicing
    physical source lines to form logical source lines. Only the last
    backslash on any physical source line shall be eligible for being part
    of such a splice.
    Except for splices reverted in a raw string literal, if a splice results in
    a character sequence that matches the
    syntax of a \grammarterm{universal-character-name}, the behavior is
    undefined. A source file that is not empty and that does not end in a \clb{new-line
    character}, or that ends in a \clb{new-line character} immediately preceded by a
    backslash character before any such splicing takes place,
    shall be processed as if an additional \clb{new-line character} were appended
    to the file.

    \item The source file is decomposed into preprocessing
    tokens\iref{lex.pptoken} and \cwhitespaces{sequences of whitespace characters
    (including comments)}. A source file shall not end in a partial
    preprocessing token or in a partial comment.
    \removed{Each comment is replaced by one space character.} 
    %\changed{New-line characters are}{Each \grammarterm{line-break} is} retained. 
    \removed{New-line characters are retained.} 
    \removed{Whether each nonempty sequence of whitespace characters other
    than new-line is retained or replaced by one space character is
    unspecified.}  Each \grammarterm{universal-character-name} outside of a header-name or a character or string literal is replaced by the designated element of the translation character set ([lex.charset]). The process of dividing a source file's
    characters into preprocessing tokens is context-dependent.
    \begin{example}
        See the handling of \tcode{<} within a \tcode{\#include} preprocessing
        directive.
    \end{example}

    \item Preprocessing directives are executed, macro invocations are
    expanded, and \tcode{_Pragma} unary operator expressions are executed.
    If a character sequence that matches the syntax of a
    \grammarterm{universal-character-name} is produced by token
    concatenation\iref{cpp.concat}, the behavior is undefined. A
    \tcode{\#include} preprocessing directive causes the named header or
    source file to be processed from phase 1 through phase 4, recursively.
    All preprocessing directives are then deleted.

    \item
    Each
    \grammarterm{basic-c-char},
    \grammarterm{basic-s-char}, and
    \grammarterm{r-char}
    in a \grammarterm{character-literal} or a \grammarterm{string-literal},
    as well as each
    \grammarterm{escape-sequence} and \grammarterm{universal-character-name}
    in a \grammarterm{character-literal} or a non-raw string literal,
    is encoded in the literal's associated character encoding as specified in
    \ref{lex.ccon} and \ref{lex.string}.

    \item
    Adjacent \grammarterm{string-literal}s are concatenated
    and a null character is appended to the result
    as specified in \ref{lex.string}.

    \item \added{The} \cwhitespaces{Whitespace characters} separating tokens are no longer
    significant. Each preprocessing token is converted into a
    token\iref{lex.token}. The resulting tokens are syntactically and
    semantically analyzed and translated as a translation unit.
    \begin{note}
        The process of analyzing and translating the tokens can occasionally
        result in one token being replaced by a sequence of other
        tokens\iref{temp.names}.
    \end{note}
    It is
    \impldef{whether the sources for
        module units and header units
        on which the current translation unit has an interface
        dependency are required to be available during translation}
    whether the sources for
    module units and header units
    on which the current translation unit has an interface
    dependency (\ref{module.unit}, \ref{module.import})
    are required to be available.
    \begin{note}
        Source files, translation
        units and translated translation units need not necessarily be stored as
        files, nor need there be any one-to-one correspondence between these
        entities and any external representation. The description is conceptual
        only, and does not specify any particular implementation.

\pnum
A preprocessing token is the minimal lexical element of the language in translation
phases 3 through 6. In this document, glyphs are used to identify elements of the basic character set ([lex.charset]) The categories of preprocessing token are: header names,
placeholder tokens produced by preprocessing \tcode{import} and \tcode{module} directives
(\grammarterm{import-keyword}, \grammarterm{module-keyword}, and \grammarterm{export-keyword}),
identifiers, preprocessing numbers, character literals (including user-defined character
literals), string literals (including user-defined string literals), preprocessing
operators and punctuators, and single non-\changed{whitespace characters}{\grammarterm{whitespace}} that do not lexically
match the other preprocessing token categories. If a U+0027 APOSTROPHE or a U+0022 QUOTATION MARK character
matches the last category, the behavior is undefined. Preprocessing tokens can be
separated by \cwhitespaces{whitespace;}\added{.}

characters (U+0020 SPACE, U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION, new-line, U+000B LINE TABULATION, and U+000C FORM FEED), or both}. As described in [cpp], in certain
circumstances during translation phase 4, \cwhitespaces{whitespace} (or the absence
thereof) serves as more than preprocessing token separation.

\pnum
A \defn{preprocessing directive} consists of a sequence of preprocessing tokens
that satisfies the following constraints:
At the start of translation phase 4,
the first token in the sequence,
referred to as a \defnadj{directive-introducing}{token},
begins with the first \changed{character in the source file
(optionally after whitespace containing no new-line characters)}{non-whitespace} or
follows \added{a sequence of} \cwhitespaces{whitespace} containing at least one \clb{new-line character},
and is

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    a \tcode{\#} preprocessing token, or

    \item
    an \keyword{import} preprocessing token
    immediately followed on the same logical line by a
    \grammarterm{header-name},
    \tcode{<},
    \grammarterm{identifier},
    \grammarterm{string-literal}, or
    \tcode{:}
    preprocessing token, or

    \item
    a \keyword{module} preprocessing token
    immediately followed on the same logical line by an
    \grammarterm{identifier},
    \tcode{:}, or
    \tcode{;}
    preprocessing token, or

    \item
    an \keyword{export} preprocessing token
    immediately followed on the same logical line by
    one of the two preceding forms.
\end{itemize}

The last token in the sequence is the first token within the sequence that
is immediately followed by \cwhitespaces{whitespace} containing a \clb{new-line character}.
\begin{note}
    Thus, preprocessing directives are commonly called ``lines''.
    These ``lines'' have no other syntactic significance,
    as all \cwhitespace{whitespace} is equivalent except in certain situations
    during preprocessing (see the
    \tcode{\#}
    character string literal creation operator in~\ref{cpp.stringize}, for example).
\end{note}
\begin{note}
    A \clb{new-line character} ends the preprocessing directive even if it occurs
    within what would otherwise be an invocation of a function-like macro.
\end{note}

\begin{example}
    \begin{codeblock}
        #                       // preprocessing directive
        module ;                // preprocessing directive
        export module leftpad;  // preprocessing directive
        import <string>;        // preprocessing directive
        export import "squee";  // preprocessing directive
        import rightpad;        // preprocessing directive
        import :part;           // preprocessing directive

        module                  // not a preprocessing directive
        ;                       // not a preprocessing directive

        export                  // not a preprocessing directive
        import                  // not a preprocessing directive
        foo;                    // not a preprocessing directive

        export                  // not a preprocessing directive
        import foo;             // preprocessing directive (ill-formed at phase 7)

        import ::               // not a preprocessing directive
        import ->               // not a preprocessing directive
    \end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
A sequence of preprocessing tokens is only a \grammarterm{text-line}
if it does not begin with a directive-introducing token.
A sequence of preprocessing tokens is only a \grammarterm{conditionally-supported-directive}
if it does not begin with any of the directive names
appearing after a \tcode{\#} in the syntax.
A \grammarterm{conditionally-supported-directive} is
conditionally-supported with
\impldef{additional supported forms of preprocessing directive}
semantics.

\pnum
At the start of phase 4 of translation,
the \grammarterm{group} of a \grammarterm{pp-global-module-fragment} shall
contain neither a \grammarterm{text-line} nor a \grammarterm{pp-import}.

\pnum
When in a group that is skipped\iref{cpp.cond}, the directive
syntax is relaxed to allow any sequence of preprocessing tokens to occur between
the directive name and the following \clb{new-line character}.

\pnum
\begin{removedblock}
The only whitespace characters that shall appear
between preprocessing tokens
within a preprocessing directive
(from just after the directive-introducing token
through just before the terminating new-line character)
are space and horizontal-tab
(including spaces that have replaced comments
or possibly other whitespace characters
in translation phase 3).
\end{removedblock}

\begin{addedblock}
Only \grammarterm{horizontal-whitespace}{s} can appear between preprocessing tokens within a preprocessing directive.
\end{addedblock}

\ednote{multi-line comments containing line-breaks are considered atomic \grammarterm{horizontal-whitespace}{s} after phase 3}

\pnum
The implementation can
process and skip sections of source files conditionally,
include other source files,
import macros from header units,
and replace macros.
These capabilities are called
\defn{preprocessing},
because conceptually they occur
before translation of the resulting translation unit.

\pnum
The preprocessing tokens within a preprocessing directive
are not subject to macro expansion unless otherwise stated.

\begin{example}
    In:
    \begin{codeblock}
        #define EMPTY
        EMPTY   #   include <file.h>
    \end{codeblock}
    the sequence of preprocessing tokens on the second line is \textit{not}
    a preprocessing directive, because it does not begin with a \tcode{\#} at the start of
    translation phase 4, even though it will do so after the macro \tcode{EMPTY}
    has been replaced.

The expression that controls conditional inclusion
shall be an integral constant expression except that
identifiers

are interpreted as described below
\begin{footnote}
    Because the controlling constant expression is evaluated

    all identifiers either are or are not macro names ---
    there simply are no keywords, enumeration constants, etc.

and it may contain zero or more \grammarterm{defined-macro-expression}{s} and/or
\grammarterm{has-include-expression}{s} and/or

\pnum
A \grammarterm{defined-macro-expression} evaluates to \tcode{1}
if the identifier is currently defined
as a macro name
(that is, if it is predefined
or if it has one or more active macro definitions\iref{cpp.import},
for example because
it has been the subject of a
\tcode{\#define}
preprocessing directive
without an intervening
\tcode{\#undef}
directive with the same subject identifier), \tcode{0} if it is not.

\pnum
The second form of \grammarterm{has-include-expression}

in which case the preprocessing tokens are processed just as in normal text.

\pnum
The header or source file identified by
the parenthesized preprocessing token sequence
in each contained \grammarterm{has-include-expression}
is searched for as if that preprocessing token sequence
were the \grammarterm{pp-tokens} in a \tcode{\#include} directive,
except that no further macro expansion is performed.
If such a directive would not satisfy the syntactic requirements
of a \tcode{\#include} directive, the program is ill-formed.
The \grammarterm{has-include-expression} evaluates
to \tcode{1} if the search for the source file succeeds, and
to \tcode{0} if the search fails.

\pnum
Each \grammarterm{has-attribute-expression} is replaced by
a non-zero \grammarterm{pp-number}
matching the form of an \grammarterm{integer-literal}
if the implementation supports an attribute
with the name specified by interpreting
the \grammarterm{pp-tokens}, after macro expansion,
as an \grammarterm{attribute-token},
and by \tcode{0} otherwise.
The program is ill-formed if the \grammarterm{pp-tokens}
do not match the form of an \grammarterm{attribute-token}.

\pnum
For an attribute specified in this document,
the value of the \grammarterm{has-attribute-expression}

The identifiers \xname{has_include} and \xname{has_cpp_attribute}
shall not appear in any context not mentioned in this subclause.

\pnum
Each preprocessing token that remains (in the list of preprocessing tokens that

after all macro replacements have occurred
shall be in the lexical form of a token\iref{lex.token}.

\pnum
Preprocessing directives of the forms
\begin{ncsimplebnf}\obeyspaces
    \indextext{\idxcode{\#if}}%

    \indextext{\idxcode{\#elif}}%
    \terminal{\# elif   } constant-expression \clb{new-line} \opt{group}
\end{ncsimplebnf}
check whether the controlling constant expression evaluates to nonzero.

\pnum
Prior to evaluation,
macro invocations in the list of preprocessing tokens
that will become the controlling constant expression
are replaced
(except for those macro names modified by the
\tcode{defined}
unary operator),
just as in normal text.
If the token
\tcode{defined}
is generated as a result of this replacement process
or use of the
\tcode{defined}
unary operator does not match one of the two specified forms
prior to macro replacement,
the behavior is undefined.

\pnum
After all replacements due to macro expansion and
evaluations of
\grammarterm{defined-macro-expression}s,
\grammarterm{has-include-expression}s, and
\grammarterm{has-attribute-expression}s
have been performed,
all remaining identifiers and keywords,
except for
\tcode{true}
and
\tcode{false},
are replaced with the \grammarterm{pp-number}
\tcode{0},
and then each preprocessing token is converted into a token.
\begin{note}
    An alternative
    token\iref{lex.digraph} is not an identifier,
    even when its spelling consists entirely of letters and underscores.
    Therefore it is not subject to this replacement.
\end{note}

\pnum
The resulting tokens comprise the controlling constant expression
which is evaluated according to the rules of~\ref{expr.const}
using arithmetic that has at least the ranges specified
in~\ref{support.limits}. For the purposes of this token conversion and evaluation
all signed and unsigned integer types
act as if they have the same representation as, respectively,
\tcode{intmax_t} or \tcode{uintmax_t}\iref{cstdint}.
\begin{note}
    Thus on an
    implementation where \tcode{std::numeric_limits<int>::max()} is \tcode{0x7FFF}
    and \tcode{std::numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max()} is \tcode{0xFFFF},
    the integer literal \tcode{0x8000} is signed and positive within a \tcode{\#if}
    expression even though it is unsigned in translation phase
    7\iref{lex.phases}.
\end{note}
This includes interpreting \grammarterm{character-literal}s, which may involve
converting escape sequences into execution character set members.
Whether the numeric value for these \grammarterm{character-literal}s
matches the value obtained when an identical \grammarterm{character-literal}
occurs in an expression
(other than within a
\tcode{\#if}
or
\tcode{\#elif}
directive)
is \impldef{numeric values of \grammarterm{character-literal}s in \tcode{\#if}
    directives}.
\begin{note}
    Thus, the constant expression in the following
    \tcode{\#if}
    directive and
    \tcode{if} statement\iref{stmt.if}
    is not guaranteed to evaluate to the same value in these two
    contexts:
    \begin{codeblock}
        #if 'z' - 'a' == 25
        if ('z' - 'a' == 25)
    \end{codeblock}
\end{note}
Also, whether a single-character \grammarterm{character-literal} may have a negative
value is \impldef{negative value of \grammarterm{character-literal} in preprocessor}.
Each subexpression with type
\tcode{bool}
is subjected to integral promotion before processing continues.

\pnum
Preprocessing directives of the forms
\begin{ncsimplebnf}\obeyspaces
    \terminal{\# ifdef  } identifier \clb{new-line} \opt{group}\br
    \indextext{\idxcode{\#ifdef}}%
    \terminal{\# ifndef } identifier \clb{new-line} \opt{group}
    \indextext{\idxcode{\#ifndef}}%
\end{ncsimplebnf}
check whether the identifier is or is not currently defined as a macro name.
Their conditions are equivalent to
\tcode{\#if}
\tcode{defined}
\grammarterm{identifier}
and
\tcode{\#if}
\tcode{!defined}
\grammarterm{identifier}
respectively.

\pnum
Each directive's condition is checked in order.
If it evaluates to false (zero),
the group that it controls is skipped:
directives are processed only through the name that determines
the directive in order to keep track of the level
of nested conditionals;
the rest of the directives' preprocessing tokens are ignored,
as are the other preprocessing tokens in the group.
Only the first group
whose control condition evaluates to true (nonzero) is processed;
any following groups are skipped and their controlling directives
are processed as if they were in a group that is skipped.
If none of the conditions evaluates to true,
and there is a
\tcode{\#else}
\indextext{\idxcode{\#else}}%
directive,
the group controlled by the
\tcode{\#else}
is processed; lacking a
\tcode{\#else}
directive, all the groups until the
\tcode{\#endif}
\indextext{\idxcode{\#endif}}%
are skipped.%
\begin{footnote}
    As indicated by the syntax,
    a preprocessing token cannot follow a
    \tcode{\#else}
    or
    \tcode{\#endif}
    directive before the terminating \clb{new-line character}.
    However,
    comments can appear anywhere in a source file,
    including within a preprocessing directive.

A preprocessing directive of the form

places
for a header identified uniquely by the specified sequence
between the

\tcode{>}
delimiters,
and causes the replacement of that
directive by the entire contents of the header.
How the places are specified
or the header identified
is \impldef{search locations for \tcode{<>} header}.

\pnum
A preprocessing directive of the form
\begin{ncsimplebnf}

causes the replacement of that
directive by the entire contents of the
source file identified by the specified sequence between the
\tcode{"}
delimiters.
The named source file is searched for in an
\impldef{manner of search for included source file}
manner.
If this search is not supported,
or if the search fails,
the directive is reprocessed as if it read
\begin{ncsimplebnf}
    \terminal{\# include <} h-char-sequence \terminal{>} \clb{new-line}

A preprocessing directive of the form

The preprocessing tokens after
\tcode{include}
in the directive are processed just as in normal text
(i.e., each identifier currently defined as a macro name is replaced by its
replacement list of preprocessing tokens).
If the directive resulting after all replacements does not match
one of the two previous forms, the behavior is
undefined.

    Note that adjacent \grammarterm{string-literal}s are not concatenated into

    thus, an expansion that results in two \grammarterm{string-literal}s is an
    invalid directive.

The method by which a sequence of preprocessing tokens between a
\tcode{<}

\begin{footnote}
    An alternative token\iref{lex.digraph} is not an identifier,

    It has the disadvantages of evaluating one or the other of its arguments
    a second time

Let the \defn{stringizing argument} be the preprocessing token sequence

Each \changed{occurrence of whitespace}{sequence of one or more \grammarterm{whitespace}{s}} between the stringizing argument's preprocessing

\grammarterm{string-literal}s and \grammarterm{character-literal}s:

\tcode{\textbackslash}
character of a \grammarterm{character-literal} or \grammarterm{string-literal}

replacement list is reexamined for more macro names to replace,
each instance of a

preceding preprocessing token is concatenated

Placemarker preprocessing tokens are handled specially: concatenation
of two placemarkers results in a single placemarker preprocessing token, and
concatenation of a placemarker with a non-placemarker preprocessing token results

    \terminal{\# line} pp-tokens \clb{new-line}
\end{ncsimplebnf}
(that does not match one of the two previous forms)
is permitted.
The preprocessing tokens after
\tcode{line}
on the directive are processed just as in normal text
(each identifier currently defined as a macro name is replaced by its
replacement list of preprocessing tokens).
If the directive resulting after all replacements does not match
one of the two previous forms, the behavior is undefined;
otherwise, the result is processed as appropriate.

\rSec1[cpp.error]{Error directive}%
\indextext{preprocessing directive!error}%
\indextext{\idxcode{\#error}|see{preprocessing directive, error}}

\pnum
A preprocessing directive of the form
\begin{ncsimplebnf}
    \terminal{\# error} \opt{pp-tokens} \clb{new-line}
\end{ncsimplebnf}
causes the implementation to produce
a diagnostic message that includes the specified sequence of preprocessing tokens,
and renders the program ill-formed.

\rSec1[cpp.pragma]{Pragma directive}%
\indextext{preprocessing directive!pragma}%
\indextext{\idxcode{\#pragma}|see{preprocessing directive, pragma}}

\pnum
A preprocessing directive of the form
\begin{ncsimplebnf}
    \terminal{\# pragma} \opt{pp-tokens} \clb{new-line}
\end{ncsimplebnf}
causes the implementation to behave
in an \impldef{\tcode{\#pragma}} manner.
The behavior may cause translation to fail or cause the translator or
the resulting program to behave in a non-conforming manner.
Any pragma that is not recognized by the implementation is ignored.

\rSec1[cpp.null]{Null directive}%
\indextext{preprocessing directive!null}

\pnum
A preprocessing directive of the form
\begin{ncsimplebnf}
    \terminal{\#} \clb{new-line}
\end{ncsimplebnf}
has no effect.
