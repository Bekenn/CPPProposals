\section{Abstract}

\grammarterm{string-literal}{s} can appear in a context where they are not used to
initialize a character array, but are used at compile time for diagnostic messages,
preprocessing, and other implementation-defined behaviors.
This paper clarifies how compilers should handle these strings.


\section{Motivation}

A \grammarterm{string-literal} can appear in \tcode{_Pragma}, \tcode{asm}, \tcode{extern},
\tcode{static_assert}, \tcode{[[deprecated]]} and \tcode{[[nodiscard]]} attributes...

In all of these cases, the strings are exclusively used at compile time by the compiler, and are as such not evaluated in phase 6.
This means they should not be converted to the narrow encoding or any literal encoding specified by an encoding prefix (L, u, U, u8).

Their encoding should therefore not be constrained or otherwise specified,
except that these strings can contain any Unicode characters.

This proposal aims to identify contexts in which strings are not evaluated so that they can be handled consistently by compilers.

\section{Revisions}

\subsection{R6}
Apply core feedback:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reword [over.literal]
\item Revert the changes to [cpp]
\item Rebase the wording in [dcl.pre]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{R5}
\begin{itemize}
\item Re-specify \tcode{asm} declarations to accept any \grammarterm{balanced-token-seq} rather than trying to put constraints on the
\grammarterm{string-literal} they are currently specified to accept. This simplifies the specification and more closely matches existing practices.
\textbf{Following EWG review, additional wording has been added to make it clear that an implementation does not have to support \tcode{asm} statements or any grammar therein}.
The intent of the proposal is to allow implementer to either allow any kind of grammar they want in \tcode{asm} statements, or allow no grammar whatsoever; No implementation would have to
change its handling of \tcode{asm} statements with this proposal.
Further work to remove [decl.asm] entierly wile leaving the \tcode{asm} keyword reserved for vendor extensions could be the object of a separate paper.

\item Fix a number of typos.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{R4}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rebase the wording and wording tweaks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{R3}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improve wording by not making \grammarterm{unevaluated-string} preprocessing token as preprocessing tokens should not be context dependent. Fix the wording of \tcode{\#line} and \tcode{\_Pragma} accordingly.
    \item Append null-terminator during evaluation of string-literals to make it clear that \grammarterm{unevaluated-string} are not null-terminated.
    \item Adapt the grammar of \grammarterm{literal-operator-id}
    \item Adapt the wording of \tcode{extern} to clarify that the likage specification denotes unicode characters.
    \item Allow numeric escape sequences in asm statements.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{R2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \grammarterm{unevaluated-string-literal} to \grammarterm{unevaluated-string}.
    \item Add a note about not disallowing non-printable characters
    \item Add a note about \grammarterm{unevaluated-string} not being expressions.
    \item Fix typos.
    \item Improve wording.
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposal}

Unevaluated string literals can appear in

\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{_Pragma}
\item \tcode{\#line} directives
%\item \tcode{header-name}
\item \tcode{[[nodiscard]]} and \tcode{[[deprecated]]} attributes
\item \tcode{extern} linkage specifications
\item \tcode{asm} statements
\item \tcode{static_assert}
\item literal operator
\end{itemize}

We propose that in all of these cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item No prefix is allowed
\item The string is not converted to the execution encoding.
\item \tcode{universal-character-name} and \tcode{simple-escape-sequence} (except \tcode{\textbackslash 0} ) are replaced by
the corresponding Unicode codepoints, and other escape sequences are ill-formed.
\end{itemize}

This last point is important. Because the encoding the compiler will convert these strings to is not known, and because UCNs can represent any Unicode characters,
numeric-escape-sequences have no use beyond forcing the compiler to contend with invalid
code units in diagnostic messages.

All of these changes are breaking changes.
However, a survey of open source projects tends to show that none of the restrictions added
impact existing code.

\textbf{This proposal does not specify how unevaluated strings are presented in diagnostic messages}.

\subsection{Non-printable characters and escape sequences}

This proposal does not attempt to restrict further the characters allowed in unevaluated strings.
In particular, they may contain all matter of space, control characters, invisible characters, and alert.
The handling of these characters in diagnostic messages is left as quality of implementation, mostly
for simplicity. The alternative would be to only allow graphic characters (General_Category L, M, N, P, S + spaces).

\section{Alternative considered}

\subsection{Allowing and ignoring any prefix}

This is arguably the status quo.
The issue is that it is hard to teach. Users should be able to expect for example that L"X"
is always in the wide execution encoding.
It could be argued that \tcode{"foo"} not being in the narrow-encoding is also confusing, however, there is precedence for that in headers names (which are already not \grammarterm{string-literals}{s}).

\subsection{Allowing prefixes and encode all strings using that prefix}

This is both implementer- and user-hostile. It would force users to use any of u, u8, U
on all of their \tcode{static_assert} which contain non-ASCII characters as it is the only way to obtain a portable encoding.
It has the advantage of being mostly consistent (all strings except those in headers names would be encoded using the encoding associated with their prefix) but would break
existing code using non-ASCII characters in \tcode{static_assert} and attributes and
litter C++ code with these prefixes, which seems to be a net negative.

\section{\tcode{asm} declarations}

Several people in SG22, as well as an implementer, raised concerns about banning numeric escape sequences
in asm statement as supposedly an implementation could do "something" here.
Given the implementation-defined, conditionally supported nature of \tcode{asm} declarations, and existing practice, we decided to modify the grammar to accept any balanced token sequence (which includes string literals).
This is consistent with GCC's "extended asm" syntax, notably.
Implementations that support a single string literal in \tcode{asm} declarations can, of course, continue to do so with no change required to their
implementation and are free to put whichever requirements they need on them.
This does not requires an implementation to be able to parse arbitrary \grammarterm{balanced-token-seq} either.
The intent is that any \grammarterm{balanced-token-seq} not recognized by an implementation that would otherwise support \tcode{asm} statements
can be ill-formed.

\section{Compilers survey}

\subsection{_Pragma}

In \tcode{_Pragma} directives, the standard specifies that the \tcode{L} prefix is ignored.
In C, all encoding prefixes are ignored. This divergence is highlighted in \paper{CWG897}.
MSVC does not support \tcode{_Pragma(L"")}.  Only Clang supports other prefixes in \tcode{_Pragma}.

Out of the 90 million lines of code of the 1300+ open source projects available on vcpkg, a
single use of that feature was found within clangâ€™s lexer test suite, for a total of 2000 uses
of \tcode{_Pragma}. Similarly, the only uses of \tcode{_Pragma (u8"")}, \tcode{_Pragma (u"")}, \tcode{_Pragma (U"")}, etc were
found in Clangâ€™s test suite (both because these are valid C and because neither GCC nor Clang
are conforming, only \tcode{L""} is described as valid by the C++ standard).

\subsection{Attributes}

Clang does not support strings with an encoding prefix in attributes, other compilers accept them.


\subsection{\tcode{static_assert}}

All compilers support strings with an encoding prefix in static assert.
MSVC appears to convert the string to the encoding associated with that prefix before displaying it, producing mojibake if a string
cannot be represented in the literal encoding.
The following diagnostics are emmited by MSVC with \tcode{/execution-charset:ascii}:
\begin{quoteblock}
\begin{codeblock}
static_assert(false, "Your code is on @\emoji{ðŸ”¥}@");

<source>(1): warning C4566: character represented by universal-character-name
'\u00F0'  cannot be represented in the current code page (20127)
<source>(1): warning C4566: character represented by universal-character-name
'\u0178'  cannot be represented in the current code page (20127)
<source>(1): warning C4566: character represented by universal-character-name

<source>(1): warning C4566: character represented by universal-character-name
'\u00A5' cannot be represented in the current code page (20127)
<source>(1): error C2338: ????

static_assert(false, u8"Your code is on @\emoji{ðŸ”¥}@");
<source>(1): error C2002: invalid wide-character constant
\end{codeblock}
\end{quoteblock}
\subsection{\tcode{extern} \& \tcode{asm}}

No compiler support strings with an encoding prefix in extern and asm statements.

\subsection{\tcode{\#line}}

GCC and  Clang do not support encoding prefix in \tcode{\#line} directives.

\section{Future direction}

This proposal does not prevent supporting constant expression in \tcode{static_assert} or attributes in
the future; we can imagine the following grammar:

\begin{bnf}
    \nontermdef{static_assert-declaration}\br
    \keyword{static_assert} \terminal{(} constant-expression \terminal{)} \terminal{;}\br
    \keyword{static_assert} \terminal{(} constant-expression \terminal{,} unevaluated-string \terminal{)} \terminal{;}\br
    \keyword{static_assert} \terminal{(} constant-expression \terminal{,} constant-expression \terminal{)} \terminal{;}
\end{bnf}

Those may make \tcode{static_assert(true, u8"foo");} valid again as \tcode{u8"foo"} would be a valid constant expression.


\section{Implementability}

This proposal requires implementations to keep around a non-encoded string for diagnostic purposes.
This has recently come up in a clang patch to support EBCDIC as the literal encoding.
To support diagnostics in this context, especially on a non-EBCDIC platform the original sequence of characters must be retained.
This proposal offers a well-specified, portable mechanism to solve this problem.

\section{Wording Challenges}

Strings are handled in phases 5 and 6 before the program is parsed,
which might force us to have a "reversal" of these phases.
\grammarterm{string-literal} and \grammarterm{unevaluated-string-literal} only differ by the context in which they may appear.

It is important to note that \grammarterm{unevaluated-string}, by virtue of not being evaluated, are not C++ expressions.
They are purposefully left out of the \grammarterm{literal} grammar.
Not being literal, and not being expressions, \grammarterm{unevaluated-string} do not have a value category.

\section{Previous works}

\paper{P2246R1} removes wording specific to attributes mandating that diagnostic with characters
from the basic characters are displayed in diagnostic messages, which was not implementable.

    \item
    a function call expression\iref{expr.call}
    that calls a function declared \tcode{nodiscard} in a reachable declaration or
    whose return type is a nodiscard type, or
    \item
    an explicit type
    conversion~(\ref{expr.type.conv}, \ref{expr.static.cast}, \ref{expr.cast})
    that constructs an object through
    a constructor declared \tcode{nodiscard} in a reachable declaration, or
    that initializes an object of a nodiscard type.
\end{itemize}

Recommended Practice:
Appearance of a nodiscard call as
a potentially-evaluated discarded-value expression\iref{expr.prop}
is discouraged unless explicitly cast to \tcode{void}.
Implementations should issue a warning in such cases.
\begin{note}
    This is typically because discarding the return value
    of a nodiscard call has surprising consequences.
\end{note}
The \grammarterm{\added{unevaluated-}string\removed{-literal}}

should be used in the message of the warning
as the rationale for why the result should not be discarded.

%The preprocessing tokens after
%\tcode{line}

%(each identifier currently defined as a macro name is replaced by its
%replacement list of preprocessing tokens).
%If the directive resulting after all replacements does not match
%one of the two previous forms, the behavior is undefined;
%otherwise, the result is processed as appropriate.

%A unary operator expression of the form:
%
%\begin{ncbnf}
%    \terminal{_Pragma} \terminal{(} string-literal \terminal{)}
%\end{ncbnf}
%
%is processed as follows: The \grammarterm{string-literal}
%is \defnx{destringized}{destringization} by
%\removed{deleting the \tcode{L} prefix, if present,} deleting the leading and trailing
%double-quotes,replacing each escape sequence \tcode{\textbackslash"} by a double-quote, and
%replacing each escape sequence \tcode{\textbackslash\textbackslash} by a single
%backslash. The resulting sequence of characters is processed through translation phase 3
%to produce preprocessing tokens that are executed as if they were the
%\grammarterm{pp-tokens} in a pragma directive. The original four preprocessing
%tokens in the unary operator expression are removed.

%\pnum
%\begin{example}
%\begin{codeblock}
%    #pragma listing on "..\listing.dir"
%\end{codeblock}
%can also be expressed as:
%\begin{codeblock}
%    _Pragma ( "listing on \"..\\listing.dir\"" )
%\end{codeblock}
%The latter form is processed in the same way whether it appears literally
%as shown, or results from macro replacement, as in:
%\begin{codeblock}
%    #define LISTING(x) PRAGMA(listing on #x)
%    #define PRAGMA(x) _Pragma(#x)
%
%    LISTING( ..\listing.dir )
%\end{codeblock}
%\end{example}
